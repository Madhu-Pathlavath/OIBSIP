# OIBSIP

## Overview

Welcome to our GitHub repository! This comprehensive project encompasses five diverse tasks, each focusing on a unique aspect of data science and machine learning. Below is a concise overview of each task:

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

Task 1 revolves around the classic Iris Flower dataset. Our aim is to implement a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying iris flower species based on their distinct features.

### Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python

In Task 2, we dive into the realm of economic analysis, leveraging Python for in-depth examination of unemployment data. The project explores trends, patterns, and insights within unemployment datasets, using various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

### Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Task 3 focuses on predictive modeling for car prices. We develop a machine learning model that considers relevant features to estimate the price of a car, facilitating informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers.

### Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

Task 4 addresses the ever-relevant issue of email spam. We implement a machine learning model to effectively classify emails as either spam or not spam, thereby enhancing email security and filtering capabilities.

### Task 5: Sales Prediction using Python

The latest addition, Task 5, centers around sales prediction. We employ Python to analyze historical sales data, build predictive models, and generate insights to aid businesses in forecasting future sales.
