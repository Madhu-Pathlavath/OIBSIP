Overview
Welcome to our GitHub repository! This project consists of four tasks, each focusing on a specific machine learning application. Below is a brief overview of each task:

Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
In this task, we delve into the classic Iris Flower dataset to implement a machine learning model for flower classification. The goal is to accurately identify iris flower species based on their features.

Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
Task 2 involves the analysis of unemployment data using Python. We explore trends, patterns, and insights within unemployment datasets, employing various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
For Task 3, our focus shifts to predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. We develop a model that takes into account relevant features to estimate the price of a car, facilitating informed decision-making for buyers and sellers.

Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Task 4 addresses the critical issue of email spam. We implement a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or not spam, enhancing email security and filtering capabilities.
